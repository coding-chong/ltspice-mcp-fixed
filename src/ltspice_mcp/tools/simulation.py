# (blocking) call stays within a typical MCP client's tool-call patience, long
# enough that most .op/.ac/small-.tran runs finish inline without forcing the
# caller into the async check_job dance. Runs expected to exceed it return a
# job_id immediately; callers can override per-call with wait=true (bounded by

# returning their parsed results directly saves every caller a check_job
# round-trip; a run that outlives the grace window continues in the background
# under the deadline watchdog (nothing is killed at grace expiry).
