"""Simulation-result analysis tools.

All tools in this module consume simulation output files (.raw, .log) and
return derived metrics. Organized by what the tool answers:

    Scalar summaries:
        signal_stats        — mean/RMS/pk-pk/etc for one signal
        query_value         — value at a specific time/frequency
        operating_point     — DC node voltages, branch currents, per-device
                              operating point (gm/gds/vth/…); device= scopes to one

    Waveform metrics (transient only, reject AC):
        edge_metrics        — rise/fall time + slew rate
        transient_response  — step settling or disturbance recovery
        timing_between      — signed delay between two signals
        periodic_metrics    — period/frequency/duty/jitter

    .MEAS extraction:
        measurement_stats   — aggregate .MEAS across sweep/MC
                                       (single-run .MEAS values are folded
                                        into simulation_summary)

    High-level overview:
