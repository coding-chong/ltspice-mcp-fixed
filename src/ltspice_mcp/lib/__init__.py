    """Open ``path`` for atomic, durable writing via tempfile-then-rename.

    Yields a writable file handle (text or binary per ``mode``). On clean
    exit the buffer is flushed, ``fsync``'d (when ``durable``), closed, and
    atomically moved over ``path``; the parent directory is then ``fsync``'d
    so the rename itself is durable. On any exception — including
    ``KeyboardInterrupt`` — the tempfile is unlinked and ``path`` is left
    untouched.

    Parameters
    ----------
    path
        Destination path. Parent directories are created if missing.
    mode
        ``"w"`` for text (default) or ``"wb"`` for binary.
    encoding
        Text encoding. Ignored in binary mode.
    durable
        When ``True`` (default), ``fsync`` the file before rename and the
        parent directory after. Use ``F_FULLFSYNC`` on macOS for true
        platter-level durability. Set ``False`` for hot-path writes where
        crash-safety-sans-durability is acceptable (e.g., caches).
    overwrite
        When ``True`` (default), replace ``path`` if it exists. When
        ``False``, raise ``FileExistsError`` instead (race-free on POSIX
        via ``os.link``; best-effort on Windows via ``os.rename``).

    Guarantees
    ----------
    * **Atomicity**: concurrent readers see either the old contents or the
      complete new contents, never a partial write.
    * **Durability** (``durable=True``): data is flushed to stable storage
      before the rename, and the rename is flushed after. Survives power
      loss on common filesystems (ext4, XFS, APFS, NTFS). On macOS the
      flush is ``F_FULLFSYNC`` (platter-level), not plain ``fsync``.
    * **Permission preservation**: if ``path`` exists, its mode is copied
      onto the replacement before rename. Fresh files inherit the
      tempfile's default mode (``0600``).
    * **Cleanup**: the tempfile is unlinked on any exception, including
      ``KeyboardInterrupt`` and ``SystemExit``.

    Caveats
    -------
    * If ``path`` is a symlink, the symlink itself is replaced — not its
      target. Pass ``path.resolve()`` if you want the target replaced.
    * On Windows, ``os.replace`` may briefly fail with ``PermissionError``
      if another process (e.g., antivirus) has the file open; no retry
      is attempted.
    * ``overwrite=False`` on Windows has a TOCTOU window between the
      existence check (implicit in ``os.rename``) and the rename itself.
      POSIX uses ``os.link``, which is race-free.
