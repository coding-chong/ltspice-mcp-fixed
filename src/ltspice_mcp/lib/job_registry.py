"""In-memory registry for simulation and batch jobs.

Owns the single union ``jobs`` dict (job_id -> SimulationJob | BatchJob)
plus all disk-persistence coordination (sidecar writes, eviction,
interrupted-job recovery). Split out of ``SessionState`` so the
per-session container stays focused on simulator catalog, caches, and
configuration.

``SessionState`` delegates its job-facing API to this class; call sites
continue to use ``state.jobs``, ``state.add_job``, etc. The ``sim_jobs``
and ``batch_jobs`` attributes are type-filtered writable views over the
union store, so per-type call sites keep their old dict semantics.
