"""Domain dataclasses for simulation and batch jobs.

This module is the leaf of the job-subsystem dependency graph: it
defines the types and nothing else. Extracting these from ``state.py``
broke a cluster of import cycles where ``state`` imported its
collaborators (``lib.job_registry``, ``lib.job_store``, ``lib.job_lifecycle``,
``lib.observability``) and those collaborators needed the dataclasses
back for their type signatures.

After this split, the graph is strictly layered:

    lib.job_types (this file)
        ↑
        ├── state (SessionState composes JobRegistry)
        ├── lib.job_registry (owns sim_jobs / batch_jobs dicts)
        ├── lib.job_lifecycle (transition chokepoint)
        ├── lib.observability (event emission)
        ├── lib.job_store (disk persistence)
        └── lib.{sim,sweep,montecarlo}_runner

No TYPE_CHECKING guards remain in the collaborators — they import
these classes at runtime cleanly. ``state.py`` re-exports every name
below so downstream code that wrote ``from ltspice_mcp.state import
SimulationJob`` keeps working.
