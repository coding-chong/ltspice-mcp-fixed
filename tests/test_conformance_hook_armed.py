"""Guards that the output-schema conformance hook actually protects, and that
the end-to-end scenario script only calls tools that still exist.

The session-scoped hook in ``conftest.py`` validates every ``structuredContent``
emission against its tool's declared ``output_schema``. It can quietly stop
protecting anything in two ways: the handler-frame walk finds no match and
skips validation, or the response-helper patch never takes effect and the
unpatched helpers run. The first test pins both at once: a rejection is only
possible when the patched helper runs AND the frame walk attributes the
emission, so forcing a real schema violation through a registered handler
proves the whole chain is armed.

The second test keeps ``scenario_active_filter.py`` honest: a renamed or
removed tool would leave the script calling a name the server no longer
answers to, and the script isn't exercised by the normal suite.
